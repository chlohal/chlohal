# 👋 Hi! 

Hi! I'm Chloe O. Halverson. I'm a developer, designer, coder, editor, educator, and Et Cetera™, currently studying Computer Science at Clark University.

I love teaching people about computer science as well as coding myself. I'm primarily a web developer (HTML/CSS/JS), but I've done several terminal-interface or library projects. I also have (moderate) experience in Java and (minor) experience in Python.

I'm currently working on becoming a better technical writer. If you have any advice, please let me know!
